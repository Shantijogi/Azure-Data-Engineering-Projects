# Azure Data Engineering Projects
End-to-end Azure Data Engineering projects using Data Factory, Data Lake, SQL Database, and more with Medallion architecture and real-world data integration


This repository contains projects built using Azure Data Engineering tools and services.

Projects include data pipelines, transformations, and storage using:
- Azure Data Factory
- Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS)
- Azure Blob Storage
- Azure SQL Database
- Cosmos DB
- ADS
- Azure Databricks
- On-premise sources like MySQL

Each project follows a structured approach using the Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold) to organize and process data for analytics.

Final outputs are stored in Azure SQL or ADLS and are ready for reporting tools like Power BI.
